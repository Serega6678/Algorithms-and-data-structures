Non convex simple polygon is given. For every given point the program must tell whether the point is INSIDE polygon, on it's BORDER or OUTSIDE of it. Total completixy is O(nlogn) for n points given.

Input format:

T - number of tests

{

	N - number of polygon vertices

	{

		x, y - vertex coordinates

	} repeats N times

	K - number of points to check

	{

		x, y - point coordinates

	} repeats K times

} repeats T times
